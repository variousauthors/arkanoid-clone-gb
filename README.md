# Dragon Quest Valley 01 Folly

The first of many follies along the road to dragon quest valley 01

I made a lovely tile set that included some low contrast cliffs that
I really enjoyed. Unfortunately I later realized that I can't have
cliffs given the current collision system. Cliffs and passing
under tiles are beyond the scope of the current valley. This
is a little branch that I hope to pick up again after valley 01
is finished, where I can potentially add those features.
