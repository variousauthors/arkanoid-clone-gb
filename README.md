# Dragon Quest Valley 01 Folly

The first of many follies along the road to dragon quest valley 01

I made a lovely tile set that included some low contrast cliffs that
I really enjoyed. Unfortunately I later realized that I can't have
cliffs given the current collision system. Cliffs and passing
under tiles are beyond the scope of the current valley. This
is a little branch that I hope to pick up again after valley 01
is finished, where I can potentially add those features.

### Cliff Tiles

I love verticality and cliff tiles in RPGs so naturally I tried adding them.
While preparing to add the cliff tiles in Pyxel Edit I accidentally created this:

To me, this looks like a cliff-side even before adding a texture. That struck
me as very powerful, that my eye had gotten so used to a certain kind of
isometric cliff-side I could see it even in the absense of detail. I thought
it would be nice to add the minimum amount of additional information
rather than a more traditional noisy rocky tile:

I got a little carried away, and ended up with like 50 tiles worth of cliff 
twists and edges, and a nice little mockup.

As soon as I added it to the game I realized that my simple collision bit
would not be enough to allow a player to move around in this space. For a
moment my resolve waivered (hmm I could just add...) but I caught myself in
time and am thus folding this little folly away.
